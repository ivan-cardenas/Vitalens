# INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

##	BACKGROUND FOR VITALENSâ€™ DEVELOPMENT

The Dutch system of drinking water provision is reaching its limits due to drought, salinization and an increasing demand for water due to a growing population, regional urban expansion and economy (Vewin 2022). Overijjsel South is one of the regions where security of drinking water supply is at risk immediately if actions are not taken right away (Figure 1, Vewin 2022). In the province of Overijssel, reserves that could be immediately available are insufficient for the current water demand (RIVM 2023). 
 
Vitens is, amongst other regions, responsible for providing drinking water in Overijssel Zuid (Figure 2). At Vitens, different policies are being discussed, including major investments in new infrastructure, such as a long-distance pipeline from Deventer to supply drinking water. However, such major investments will take more than ten years to plan and implement, while Vitens also needs to take immediate action to ensure the security of supply. 

This is where the Vitalens tool steps in. The tool includes measures that can be implemented within the next ten years to alleviate immediate concerns about the security of supply and bridge the gap until other major investments can be completed. The tool allows for exploring short-term options that Vitens and other key regional stakeholders could take. It aims to provide a basis for discussions about the measures that could be taken and their potential impacts on other key performance indicators. Therefore, the main target audience is Vitens staff and possibly key stakeholders outside of Vitens. 

## 1.2	TOOL OVERVIEW

The data fed into Vitalens 1.0 comprised data collected by Vitens, the Dutch statistical office (CBS) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). Furthermore, a hydrological model was run by Vitens to estimate the potential effects of changing water extraction volumes. Vitalens 1.0 does not simulate new results but provides an overview of these existing data. The tool was intentionally kept simple and is supposed to serve as a starting point for discussions about measures. 

In a nutshell, Vitalens 1.0
*	Focuses on potential outcomes in 2035;
*	Is based on existing empirical data, estimates and external model results;
*	Visualises key relations between measures and outcomes in a simplified way;
*	Focusses on water supply and demand measures that can be taken by Vitens and collaborating stakeholders, related to residential water use, small businesses and selected larger industries. 

### Vitalens simplifies the water balance drastically (Figure 3). Vitalens incorporates
*	Groundwater extraction by Vitens;
*	Drinking water consumption by residents and small businesses;
*	Large industrial water extraction: Users can decide to redirect industrial groundwater extraction to other users. Industrial water extraction is not included in overall demand and supply figures. 
*	Measures that can be taken by Vitens and other stakeholders until 2035, and measures are assumed to be implemented without delay;
*	Four balance areas as used by Vitens. For the total water balance of Overijjsel Zuid, it is assumed that water can be transported between the balance areas. 

### Vitalens does not include
*	Agricultural water extraction and other industries;
*	Surface water;
*	The network structure consisting of pumps, pipes and other infrastructure transporting the water from extraction points to consumers;
*	A time series of how the transition through stepwise implementation happens;


### Users of Vitalens can determine demand by setting scenario options: 
*	Population:
*	Population number in 2022 (CBS 2023b)
*	Population number in 2035 as predicted by CBS (2023a)
*	Population number in 2035 as predicted by CBS (2023a) plus 1%
*	Water demand by small businesses
*	Water demand as in 2022 according to Vitens (2023)
*	Water demand as in 2022 plus 10%
*	Water demand as in 2022 plus 35%



### Users of the Vitalens tool can explore the potential impacts of a variety of measures:
*	Measures influencing water demand:
*	Setting residential water demand to 135 (standard), 120, 100 or 90l/person and day
*	Introducing smart meters, assuming a 5% reduction in water demand
*	Measures influencing water supply
*	Closing small wells with less than 5 Mm3/year
*	Closing of wells within or less than 100m away from Natura2000 sites
*	Importing 4.5 Mm3/year of water (including from Germany) 
*	Retracting 1.66 Mm3/year industrial permits and using these for drinking water supply
*	Modifying the amount of water extraction for individual extraction locations.
