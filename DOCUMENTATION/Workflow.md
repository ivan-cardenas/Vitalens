# WORKFLOW - HOW TO USE VITALENS

1.	Make assumptions about the population number and the water demand for small businesses in the upper left corner on the tab “1. Scenario’s” (Figure 4a). 
2.	Select measures influencing the water supply in the upper left corner in the tab “2. Aanbod” (Figure 4b). Note that you can influence a range of extraction areas simultaneously by closing all small wells or all wells close to Natura 2000 sites. This will influence what you see in step 4. 
3.	Select measures influencing the water demand of households in the upper left corner in the tab “3. Vraag” (Figure 4c). 
4.	Modify the extraction capacity of all wells in the lower left corner in the tab “4. Putcapaciteiten” (Figure 4d). Note that you can change all extraction areas at once by increasing or decreasing their capacity. You can also turn individual extraction areas on or off. Depending on your screen size, you may have to scroll down to see a list of extraction areas organised by balance area. 
5.	Create a report and download the pdf with all settings and outcomes in the lower left corner in the tab “5. Rapport genereren” (Figure 4e). This feature is only available if Vitalens is installed on a local server.
